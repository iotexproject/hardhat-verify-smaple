# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
```

delpoy 

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/MyContract.ts --network mainnet
```

verify
```shell
hardhat verify  0x181deCBaFE0F85e8c3EfBb80167fE0F6e743Ba65 ZZTEST ZZTEST --network mainnet
```
